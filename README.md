# Chapters

This project is a Social Media full MERN Stack application called Chapters. Here you can post anything you want to, upload pictures with your post, give and receive likes, leave hash tags on post, and delete any posts you feel embarrassed about. This group project was created by Austin Swebilius, Tucker Brown, and Jauvonta Etheridge as for the UCF FullStack Coding Boot Camp.

# Installation

To install this application and test out locally, simply clone the Git Repository. Once done you will need to navigate to the Server Folder and open and integrated terminal. There you will need to type "npm i express; npm i mongoose; npm i body-parser; npm i cors; npm i node; npm i nodemon; and npm i dotenv;". With the needed dependencies installed, while still in your terminal type "npm start" to start up the server.

Now navigate to your Src Folder within your Client Folder and open another terminal. There you will need to type "npm i react-redux; npm i redux-thunk; npm i react-file-base64; npm i axios; npm i moment; npm i react-scripts;". Once those dependencies are installed you are then ready to type "npm start" to start up react locally and begin testing.

# Challenges

Git Hub merge conflicts cost us a lot of time and work causing us to lose a lot of progress when accidentally accepting the wrong changes. Because of this, most of the project had to be recoded from scratch. Heroku Deployment also had issues but worked in the end.
